Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_client}{Client}} \\*Acts as the controller for the game, it holds the player, map and communicates to the server }{\pageref{class_client}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_client_snapshot}{Client\+Snapshot}} \\*The \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_client_snapshot}{Client\+Snapshot}} is a simplified version of the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_client}{Client}}, it is used by the server to keep track of the game state }{\pageref{struct_client_snapshot}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_map}{Map}} \\*The map game object is the racetrack itself. It can detect if a player is on the track or the grass and set their speed accordingly }{\pageref{class_map}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_placement_order}{Placement\+Order}} \\*A holder for the final positions of the racers. The first element is first place, the last element came last in the race }{\pageref{struct_placement_order}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_player}{Player}} \\*Holds all the information needed to control and draw the race cars for the game }{\pageref{class_player}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_server}{Server}} \\*The \mbox{\hyperlink{class_server}{Server}} of the racing game }{\pageref{class_server}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_tcp_data_packet}{Tcp\+Data\+Packet}} \\*Common struct between the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_server}{Server}} and the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_client}{Client}}, the \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_tcp_data_packet}{Tcp\+Data\+Packet}} is used as a container for all of the data sent in the game }{\pageref{struct_tcp_data_packet}}{}
